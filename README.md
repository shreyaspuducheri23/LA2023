My final project, titled "Quantitative Analysis of Student Performance in PY104," aimed to dissect the complex dynamics influencing student outcomes in the fall 2023 section of the PY104 course at Boston University. The project's underpinning is a mini data analysis and research approach, leveraging survey-collected data and various statistical methods, including correlation analysis, regression methods, principal component analysis, and clustering. More comprehensive results can be found at https://shreyaspuducheri23.github.io/LA2023/. 

The foundational element of this study was a survey, designed as a comprehensive Google Forms questionnaire. The survey questions, which can be found in figure 1 below, were carefully designed to gauge a broad range of factors potentially influencing performance, from academic history to personal life commitments.

I also conducted a correlation analysis, which proved to be very useful in investigating the various influences on student performance. I used the Pearson Correlation Coefficient, which is a statistical measure that quantifies the linear relationship between two variables and only considered significant relationships (p ≤ 0.05) to ensure reliability. The results of this analysis can be found in figure 2 below.

A notable positive correlation was observed between the number of office hours attended and homework scores, suggesting the effectiveness of our office hours in facilitating homework understanding. However, this engagement did not extend to other course components like quizzes or exams, suggesting that we may need to revisit the design of homework problems to better reflect exam and quiz structure. It may also indicate that we should make greater efforts to extend the homework questions addressed in office hours into discussions of potential exam topics.

Surprisingly, a negative correlation emerged between study hours and overall student performance, indicating that longer study hours did not equate to better grades, hinting at the need for more efficient study strategies. It also may indicate some degree of confoundingness in the data –  an increase in the number of hours studied may have been necessitated by a prior lack of content understanding, which could have also negatively impacted class performance. The academic year of students showed a mixed bag of correlations, positively with study hours, office hours, and missed classes, but negatively with exam and overall class performance. This suggests that while senior students engage more in terms of time and resources, their performance does not necessarily improve, possibly due to increasing extracurricular commitments. Furthermore, their senior academic status may be indicative of other factors, such as their lack of physics affinity as they may have pushed off physics until later in their academic career, explaining the negative correlation with year and interest level. 

Contrastingly, factors such as work hours, prior math classes, and prior physics classes showed no significant correlation with class performance. These findings challenge conventional assumptions, implying that external commitments and previous academic background in related subjects do not directly impact performance in PY104. These correlation patterns reveal the complexity of academic success and the importance of considering a range of factors beyond just academic background or time management.

Additionally, regression analysis was employed to further explore the relationships in the data, using three distinct methods: Random Forest, LASSO, and Multivariate Linear Regression. The Random Forest Regression, a method utilizing multiple decision trees, unfortunately yielded a low R-squared value of 0.1765. This low explanatory power suggests that the limited dataset size might have restricted the model's effectiveness. LASSO Regression, used primarily for feature selection, applied a penalty to reduce certain coefficients to zero, with alpha selection guided by metrics like AIC and BIC.

However, in the Multivariate Linear Regression, most of the parameters turned out to be insignificant, except for 'study hours,' which emerged as statistically significant. The R-squared value now increased to 0.271, which was likely due to a reduced hypothesis space caused by the linear constraints and feature selection, however it was still relatively poor. The full model parameters and scoring metrics can be found at https://shreyaspuducheri23.github.io/LA2023/. These results highlight the challenges faced in the analysis due to the dataset's sample size constraints.

I also employed Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to uncover latent factors influencing student performance in PY104. PCA is a statistical technique that transforms a set of observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components. This method helps in reducing the dimensionality of the data while retaining most of the variation in the dataset. I chose to focus on the first two principal components in the Principal Component Analysis (PCA), because of their high explained variance relative to the other principal components (Figure 4). The first two components collectively accounted for nearly 50% of the variance in the dataset, making them particularly informative.

The principal component loadings, which indicate their component features, can be found in figure 4. The first principal component indicated a latent factor of academic efficiency, marked by less time spent on studying and office hours but associated with higher grades. The second principal component, which was more characteristic of older students with good study habits but less inclination towards physics, depicted a balance between academic engagement and course material. This component explained the complex relationships between various academic and demographic factors, revealing deeper insights into the student performance dynamics in PY104.

I then employed K-means clustering to cluster the students. My choice of k clusters and n principal components was based on a grid-search of optimal cluster silhouette scores, which yielded a silhouettes core of 0.429 for k = 4 and n = 2. Figure 5 below shows a scatter plot of the clusters identified with respect to the two aforementioned principal components, along with the average course score for each cluster. The plot reveals one central cluster indicative of average class performance, but the outlying 3 clusters show some particularly interesting trends. One cluster, significantly higher on Principal Component 1, is distinguished by its strong mean performance. The other 2 outlying clusters, while lower on Principal Component 1, vary according to Principal Component 2, which could reflect different levels of academic maturity and study habits. These clusters align with the insights from the PCA, where Principal Component 1 seems to capture academic efficacy, and Principal Component 2 might be indicative of older students with better study habits but a lower inclination towards physics.

This analysis is particularly insightful in that it suggests that lagging student performance can be largely predicted on the basis of lack of academic efficacy (principal component 1), but the subset of students with lagging performance can effectively be separated into two groups on the basis of their academic seniority (principal component 2). This finding wrrants further study, and if validated then it could suggest that two distinct educational interventions are warranted in supporting these two distinct lagging student profiles.
